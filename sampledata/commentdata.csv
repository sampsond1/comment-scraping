Boulder has a high cost of living, especially for housing, and a potential lack of diversity in its population, as well as a tendency towards far left-leaning politics (in other words lack of diversity in politics). Boulder faces higher climate change risks like drought, heat, and fire. drought, heat, and wildfires, with a high percentage of buildings at risk of these hazards. Boulder's nightlife scene is not as vibrant or extensive as other larger cities, with many businesses closing relatively early. Homelessness is somewhat of an issue in Boulder too due to high cost of living there.

So by your numbers, if UTA didn't incur the debt, it would be profitable or at least break even.So maybe we don't need to scrap the system, as you say, but rather scrap the debt, or at least remove it from their budget as UTA only did as the voters wanted. In the UK, the Government actually funds the construction of the train lines and then contracts operators who run the trains.  Maybe we should do the same with UTA in Utah.  UDoT already has taken over the construction portion, or at least contracting it out.  If the debt was also handled by UDoT, even repaid via voter approved tax increases, UTA would only be brought in to operate the the lines.  As ridership and revenue increases, additional routes can be added, if revenue decreases, routes would decrease as well (as we have seen in the past).The exception to this is for cities that pay for extra service.  As it is outside of ticket revenue, service would be provided that matches the amount the city funds.So in light revenue times, Trax and FrontRunner would operate, and bus service would be minimal outside of a few strong routes and Salt Lake City.",https://www.deseret.com/business/2025/04/11/uts-to-implement-significant-service-changes-heres-what-to-know/

The accounting is complicated because of the ways one level of government counts 'revenue' from another level of government, but overall, nationwide, less than half of the cost of roads is borne by users via gas taxes, fees, etc. To make users actually pay for the overall cost of roads, or even your ""90%,"" we'd have to increase the gas tax by over a dollar per gallon.The reason there aren't profitable private rail transit companies in Utah is because we've poured literally hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money into subsidizing private automobile transit here. You can go back 75ish years to the court cases when Utah's private passenger rail companies went to courts asking to be permitted to cease operations and dissolve, and see that highway subsidies were the reason.It's completely nonsensical to think it makes sense to spend public money on roads but not on other forms of transit. If we're spending any public money on transportation, it makes sense to spend some of it on forms that have less congestion impact than adding more cars to the highway system, as well as address the needs of the portion of the public who can't drive or who prefer not to.Moral of the story: we live in a society, no man is an island, and UTA is OK.",https://www.deseret.com/business/2025/04/11/uts-to-implement-significant-service-changes-heres-what-to-know/

Locally, in modern times, the insider deals on Trax stations is not a whit behind the corruption in any other city or State; It is the kind of thing that causes some to complain about how corrupt the local GOP is.  Nationwide, it seems that various scandals circulate among mass transit systems almost like the seasonal flu making the rounds, just on a longer schedule.  MBTA in Boston, the NY/NJ mass transit system, Chicago, DC, and BART in Cali.  Every couple of years, we hear of the latest scandal in one of these.  Seems like about once every 20 years there is a scandal in each of them.When a private company is not subject to open records and open meeting laws, but has de facto taxing power to reach into the public's pockets, fraud is a given.  The only question is how long it takes to occur and then how long before it is found.  The only way to avoid this is to fundamentally change how mass transit systems are run.If you go fully private without taxpayer funding, they fold.  If you're going to grant access to taxpayer money, they need to be fully government agencies subject to open meeting and records laws, bans on insider deals, and so on.

The government would have the same burden of proof for each of these trials as in a criminal court. The government would be very hard-pressed to EVER win these cases due to this high burden placed upon it via “due process”. In the unlikely event that the government prevails against the alien then the illegal alien would have the right to appeal to many different levels of appellate courts before eventually after many years reaching the Supreme Court to request cert. Each individual deportation would literally take years. Imagine how the federal court system would be clogged up with millions of people going through this process.

Eventually the market recovered and thrived.In 2025 Trump is taking steps to correct these issues before it gets out of hand and of course the market reacted.  Only this time the stock market loss was 16% and is already starting to recover today.He already mentioned that there would be short term pain but it would produce long term gain and a stronger U.S. economy that doesn't rely on Communist China and others for vital goods our nation needs.

Deseret,Politics,-0.9866,"This argument overlooks important details and simplifies the situation.First, comparing the 1987 stock market crash to today misses crucial context. The 1987 crash was caused by inflated valuations and computerized trading, not trade imbalances or national debt. The global economy was different—no tariffs or trade wars. Trump’s trade war didn’t fix trade imbalances; it harmed U.S. businesses and consumers. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported that Trump’s tariffs cost U.S. companies billions, while China adjusted by rerouting trade to other countries, undermining the tariffs’ impact.The 16% drop in 2025, as you mention, was directly linked to these reckless trade policies. The “short-term pain” Trump promised hit farmers and manufacturers hardest, especially those impacted by retaliatory tariffs. The “long-term gain” never materialized for average Americans.The claim that Trump was addressing a “Communist China” dependency is misleading. The U.S. had already been diversifying supply chains long before his trade war. Instead of creating sustainable policies, Trump’s tariffs just caused chaos, harming businesses and consumers.

A quick google search will give many articles and commentaries on this subject. You are also correct in saying that there is an effort to reduce our dependency on China however it is still completely out of balance.  Here are some facts about this:In 2024, the U.S. imported $438.9 billion from China, totaling 13.4% of all goods imports.The U.S. goods trade deficit with China was $295.4 billion in 2024, a 5.8 percent increase over 2023.Anyway, I really do appreciate your comment and objectively stating facts.

It’s important to recognize the complexity of such events, and I’m glad we can both acknowledge that.Regarding the U.S.-Japan trade conflict in the 1980s, you’re correct that there was tension, particularly around issues like automotive exports. However, the scale of that conflict was different from today’s trade wars, especially with China. The scope of the tariffs today, impacting entire economies and global supply chains, is far-reaching and has more substantial long-term effects on businesses and consumers.On the issue of China, your data underscores the ongoing trade imbalance. While the effort to reduce dependency on China is valid, it’s important that we implement strategies that balance protecting American interests while minimizing harm to the economy and consumers.

Using authoritarian regimes as a benchmark for fiscal health is absurd.Second, the U.S. federal spending-to-GDP ratio at around 23% (Q3 2023, BEA data) is within historical norms—especially post-crisis. Under Reagan, federal spending hit similar levels. Yes, spending deserves scrutiny, but fear-mongering about insolvency while ignoring revenue is intellectually dishonest.Now tariffs: The 34-count felon’s protectionist trade policies—slapping tariffs on allies and adversaries alike—have hurt America. They raised costs for U.S. businesses and consumers, disrupted supply chains, and failed to deliver promised manufacturing gains.

Deseret,Politics,0.3291,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I’d like to unpack this a bit because some important distinctions are getting lost in the generalizations.First, no one is suggesting that every blog or college newspaper automatically deserves a White House press pass or a physical seat in the briefing room. The White House Correspondents' Association, not the administration, traditionally manages seating arrangements based on factors like reach, credibility, and historical presence—not political leanings. That’s how professional standards are maintained while still upholding the spirit of the First Amendment.Second, you mentioned that President Biden ""took away press passes from legitimate news agencies."" Could you please clarify which specific organizations you're referring to and under what circumstances those passes were revoked? It's important to look at the details—press access can be revoked for reasons such as security violations or failure to meet credentialing standards, not necessarily because of political views.Finally, while not being called on during a briefing might be frustrating for reporters, it is not a First Amendment violation. However, if press access were being selectively restricted based on ideology alone, that would be concerning. But again, evidence matters. If there's credible proof of that happening, it should be addressed transparently.Let’s move beyond vague accusations and talk specifics—because press freedom should be defended with facts, not assumptions.",https://www.deseret.com/politics/2025/04/08/trump-restores-the-associated-presss-white-house-access/

Deseret,Politics,0.831,"The claim that nobody has a constitutional right to the press briefing room oversimplifies the issue.

The press pool was still maintained, and other news outlets had access. It’s important to note that such actions were challenged, as restricting access to specific media outlets can be seen as retaliatory and inconsistent with First Amendment principles.In the case of recent press pass revocations, the issue is whether the government's actions violate the constitutional protections for a free press.

Deseret,Politics,0.9762,"The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) does not have constitutional authority but plays a significant role in press access to the White House. It is a nonprofit organization that represents journalists covering the White House and advocates for press freedoms, including organizing the annual WHCA dinner and ensuring fair treatment of journalists. Established in 1914, the WHCA has helped determine which media outlets participate in the White House press pool, a rotating group of reporters granted access to presidential events. This system allows for diverse coverage when space is limited.While the WHCA holds influence as the voice of White House reporters, it does not have a constitutional basis for its role in selecting press credentials. The power to grant or deny access ultimately resides with the executive branch. However, the WHCA’s role has been considered vital in maintaining an independent and diverse press corps, which serves as a check on government power.In February 2025, the Trump administration announced plans to control the press pool, removing the WHCA’s role in selecting journalists. This move was seen by the WHCA as an attempt to influence media coverage and limit press freedom. Critics argue that this undermines the independence of the press.

Trump’s foreign policy was so erratic that Germany literally declared the U.S. no longer a reliable partner, and France, Canada, and others forged their own alliances to sidestep American chaos.This isn’t “libs being emotional.” It’s diplomats, intelligence officials, and global leaders sounding the alarm that Trump’s ego-driven, loyalty-test foreign policy left our alliances cracked and our word suspect.So sure, call them our “same old allies.” But it’s meaningless if trust is eroded, cooperation is stalled, and the U.S. is treated like the wildcard at the summit.

Deseret,Politics,-0.9833,"Absolutely agree — this kind of consumer pessimism is not normal, and it’s deeply alarming. When sentiment falls lower than during the Great Recession, it’s not just a blip — it’s a major red flag. People don’t lose this kind of confidence unless they’re truly worried about their financial future, and that fear cuts across every demographic, which makes it even more serious.Trump’s reckless trade war policies have played a huge role. Tariffs might sound strong in speeches, but in reality, they act like taxes on American consumers. Prices go up, uncertainty rises, and businesses freeze hiring or investments. And when inflation is already tight, those added costs just crush working families and small businesses.The fact that this drop in sentiment spans all age groups, incomes, regions, and political parties proves this isn’t a partisan complaint — it’s a collective warning. It shows that Americans know what volatility, short-sighted economic moves, and leadership by chaos feel like in their real lives: empty shelves, higher bills, fewer opportunities.This level of anxiety should make any serious leader stop and ask: What are we doing wrong?

Deseret,Politics,0.8519,"There are smarter ways to improve our trade deficit. I believe it was Warren Buffet who was concerned that large trade deficits over long periods of time are detrimental to the economic wellbeing of the US.I think he suggested to use export certificates instead of tariffs. The idea was that any company that exports goods from the US can earn export certificates. In order to import goods, importers need to hold export certificates. They can either earn them themselves or buy them on the open market from those who export more than they import.The idea seems reasonable because it may even give an incentive for foreign companies to invest in the US, build things here, and then export them back to their home country. They could make a lot of money this way by selling their earned export certificates.A bonus of this system is it doesn't single out any country and thus create unnecessary animosity as tariffs do. Accordingly, the likelihood of reciprocal tariffs is lower.You can also gradually phase them in. For example, initially you start with needing a $1000 export certificate to import $10000 worth of goods. As time goes on and it appears to work, one can slowly approach a 1:1 ratio and achieve a balanced trade.",https://www.deseret.com/politics/2025/04/11/john-curtis-stay-strong-on-china-tariffs/

Logic would dictate that Hall would be the starter for next season, unless Young disclosed to Hall that he was already looking for Demin’s replacement among his world wide pool of candidates and showed him the door. Quite a gamble on KY’s part. Hall doesn’t seem like a vindictive kind of guy so it doesn’t seem he would abandon the team and leave them utterly point-guardless, especially if he had been assured he would be the starting PG. I don’t think KY gave him that assurance, and that’s why he won’t be coming back. KY seems confident he has it covered, but he needs to find probably 3 point guards now, one of which needs to be really talented and fully developed.Hall is pretty talented but unfortunately not NBA material. He may find a school (like Utah after their mass exodus of players) who will start him and give him more playing time, but it won’t be a step up from BYU.

Over the years,  Salt Lake City Politicians have allowed the surrounding area to become infested with crime and homeless.  So people stopped coming to Bee's games.

What Does Mendenhall and the City Council actually do?   Sure Mendenhall has her Mug in every photo op she can, but what does she actually do for the citizens of Salt Lake City.

Smith wants to do same thing with his “entertainment” district. In that case, though, he doesn’t own land. We do, but he wants to get us to lease it to him cheap so then he can sublease it to bars and restaurants.

Now they still can’t find an eighth FB member and a media rights deal more in the $8M range with a large portion coming from streaming services. The news on the street is the MWC new media deal will be around $6M.  So USU is facing an exit fee of $18M with a net increase of only around $2M/year. Real smart. If they would have held with the other MWC universities they would be in a lot better position. Now the PAC is chasing Conference USA teams and giving Gonzaga a full media cut with no FB program.

(I got to meet Rick twice.)I have two signed copies of his book, ""My LIfe On A Napkin."" Utah basketball has not been the same since he left. I also remember Jerry Pimm and Lynn Archibald.  I've been a Jazz fan ever since they moved to Salt Lake City in 1979. Though at that time, I was bigger UofU fan. Those early days in Salt Lake were sad ones for the Jazz. They really struggled financially during those first few years. I remember attending games at the Salt Palace for $5. It was often less than half full — maybe 5,000 fans. While the UofU games at the Special Events Center were routinely packing in 8 to 10 thousand fans a game.My oh my, how times have changed for the Runnin' Utes and the Utah Jazz. From what I understand, the Utes are now the ones who struggle to attract fans to the Huntsman Center — while the Jazz are enjoying sellouts, even in a season when they are tanking. ☹️Here's my list of who I think the top prospects in the 2025 NBA Draft are:Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, VJ Edgecombe, Khaman Maluach, Kon Knueppel, Ace Bailey, Jase Richardson and Collin Murray-Boyles — in that order.",https://www.deseret.com/sports/2025/04/10/utah-jazz-kyle-filipowski-offers-glimpse-of-potential/

We seemed to get along just fine prior to that. You already have a district board of education and a state board. Why do we want or need another layer?

I don't fault them I fault the system and I vote to try and change that. The best way to figure out what has gone wrong when a functioning machine that doesn't function so good anymore is to go back and see what changed. My parents were able to afford a house and raise kids on one income. My dad didn't have a degree but had a good job in the industrial sector. Since then we have replaced many industrial jobs with lower paying service jobs. Like it or not this was done largely due to cheap outsourced labor and yes, very low import tariffs.

With each of the shifts I mentioned before, the human workforce changed and as a result, the ""American Dream"" changed.  It will change again. But to deny history is to be taken by surprise when it repeats itself.  Ever wonder why the politicians most willing to promise they can bring back prosperity illusions from the past?  Its because they already know they won't be part of the future so why not use some deception to make their current situation better.

KSL,Business,-0.5719,"Raddie, how do you encourage people in other countries to buy more US goods?  The imbalance is that we buy more than other countries.  To lower the imbalance, they need to buy more, or we need to buy less. Since we don't have manufacturing in the Country for the far vast majority of the products we buy, we must import them.  Other Countries are smaller and can't buy much from us as we don't make much. Now, the trade imbalance situation is only referencing tangible goods, it doesn't include services.  The US is a large exporter of services.  Of these, the US has a service trade surplus with every other Country.  It is so large with most countries that we end up with a surplus in trade, if services are counted.  The only ones that we don't have a surplus with are China, Russia, and the export banned countries (i.e. Iran, North Korea, etc.). So, until all of this gets ironed out, the US people take the increased costs of goods on the chin, so to speak, and other Countries form tighter relationships to source the goods they received from the US.  This will mean that the physical goods trade imbalance will increase with nearly every other Country. Even the talk of Europe going Free Trade and no tariffs with the US won't change the imbalance, we buy far more from Europe than they buy from us.  This again is only going to get worse as many in Europe have already started to source their products from other Countries now.  This means that we will continue to see a large drop in exports and an expanding trade imbalance with Europe. But there is 1 silver lining.  With China dropping all agricultural contracts with US based farmers, the 90% of Alfalfa grown in Utah will end up sitting in the fields as it won't be shipped to China.  This means that we will see less Alfalfa grown in the State, meaning the highest water using crop in the state will be using less.  This means we will have more water in our streams, rivers, reservoirs, and lakes, including the Great Salt Lake. Even if other items are farmed, it would still be a lower impact on the water than Alfalfa and this means that the State as a whole ends up winning on this.  It is sad that many farmers will either lose their farms or have to pay more money in an effort to change what they farm.  But, as they say, that's politics.

(hummed to the tune of 10 trillion dollars of American wealth disappearing) If you can present an actual plan to achieve that through short term pain, I would get behind it. The frightening thing is that the administration seems to have no long-term plan. We throw out a tariff and all our drug problems will magically go away and we will see factories again on every corner. Right? It just isn't going to happen. Labor in the US is too expensive. You can't bring manufacturing back unless you double or triple the cost of everything we buy. If a part I want to produce costs $6 to produce in China, and $21 to produce in the US, you would have to require a 400-600% tariff to make someone consider building a factory here - and it is quite likely the new higher cost would be higher than the market would bear...and they just wouldn't buy it. The drug market is similarly not affected by tariffs. There is so much money in illegal drugs that there will ALWAYS be officials who can be bribed to let them through (and a smart drug importer would have that official purposefully catch a number of smaller shipments to make it ""look"" like they were stopping drugs, while letting larger shipments get in...) A tariff isn't going to change that. My big question is where is congress? They are the ones supposed to be in charge of tariffs - where at least there is some discussion and planning behind laws that are passed. Is congress really willing to turn a blind eye to 10 trillion dollars of lost wealth (much of which comes from retirement funds)? There should be a reason behind each tariff, rather than just ""I can put a formula into excel and come up with a great across the board solution"".

Simple example: if we have one dollar and one potato, them a potato costs one dollar. If another dollar is created so now we have two dollars, but still only one potato, the potato will cost two dollars. In other words, price increases are the result of inflation, the devaluation of the currency, and not the other way around.

Just because other countries charge tariffs doesn't mean it's a one-size-fits-all solution. Tariffs are used to protect local industries, yes, but they also lead to higher costs for consumers and can spark retaliatory measures, ultimately hurting global trade. The goal should be fair trade, not a trade war. The key point is that tariffs often hurt consumers more than they help domestic industries in the long run. For example, if a country imposes tariffs on goods from the U.S., it raises the price for consumers in that country. Similarly, U.S. consumers face higher prices when tariffs are placed on foreign goods. While they might help specific industries in the short term, tariffs don't always lead to more jobs or manufacturing—they often push companies to find cheaper alternatives, like moving production elsewhere or increasing automation. Instead of relying on tariffs, the focus should be on policies that encourage innovation, investment in local industries, and creating a competitive market that benefits workers without making everything more expensive. Countries can boost domestic manufacturing through subsidies, tax incentives, and workforce training, without resorting to the blunt tool of tariffs.

The same cycle always plays out: deflect, deny, gaslight.

In contrast, Trump's approach is broad and chaotic, imposing tariffs on virtually every country, even close allies, with little regard for long-term economic consequences. The defense of Trump's wildly inflated tariff charts—where some figures were 10 to 100 times higher than actual rates—only underscores the problem. These weren't harmless exaggerations; they were deliberate misinformation. Blaming other nations for ""taking advantage"" of us when trade relationships are often mutual and negotiated is just another part of the victim narrative that MAGA politics thrives on. We're told tariffs don't hurt consumers. That's false. Numerous studies, including those from nonpartisan economic institutes, have shown that tariffs raise prices for American consumers and businesses. These are the facts—but they're inconvenient, so they're ignored.

KSL,Business,0.8749,"Tariffs Hurt American Companies. Not Foreign Countries. With the new tariffs in the news, a lot of people ask: ""Why don't you just make your products in the USA?"" It sounds simple. It's not. There are no domestic sources for many of the raw materials we need. And even if there were, the processing facilities—the ones that turn those materials into usable parts—aren't in the U.S. anymore. So even if we brought final assembly back onshore, we'd still have to import key components—and those are now taxed at over 100%. Here's what most people don't realize: Tariffs aren't paid by foreign companies. They're paid by U.S. businesses. We get the bill. And that cost? It gets passed on to you, the customer. No company can absorb a 104% tariff and survive. These tariffs don't punish China or any other country—they're a tax on American businesses and consumers. We've actually built our products in the U.S. before—right here in Utah. We paid well. But the work was tough—hot, itchy, physically demanding. We couldn't find people who wanted to do it long-term. Even with good pay, most workers quit after a few weeks. There are easier jobs out there with better conditions that pay the same or more. And maybe the hardest truth we've learned is this: People love the idea of buying American. But when it comes time to buy, they almost always go with the cheaper option. That's not a criticism—it's just reality. We can't fix global supply chains overnight. And we definitely can't do it while being taxed into oblivion by policies that hurt the very businesses trying to stay competitive and create jobs here at home. Another common question is: ""If tariffs are so bad, why does every other country use them?"" Good question. The truth is, tariffs can work—when used strategically. They're a tool. A scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Targeted tariffs can protect key industries, push back against unfair practices, or counter dumping. They're meant to solve specific problems. But blanket tariffs—broad taxes on entire product categories—hurt everyone. They don't stop our need for those parts. They just make them cost 100% more. That cost travels down the line and lands right in your wallet. There are no winners in a blanket tariff war. Prices rise. Businesses struggle. Jobs disappear. And your paycheck buys less. We should be using trade policy like a surgeon—carefully, with purpose. Not swinging blindly and hoping something good comes out of it.

Tariffs will being countries with trade imbalances back to the negotiating table and we can get a better deal The first is flawed because US labor is so expensive, most companies bringing manufacturing back to the US will only use the least amount of labor necessary while they transition to automation.  In the end, the products will still cost more but no significant increase in jobs.  And the second if flawed because countries with massive wage disparity will always be able to make goods cheaper than we do and will always have less buying power so there will always be a trade imbalance. However, the two justifications are at odds with each other.  Are we doing it to bring manufacturing (not really jobs) back to the US or to get a better trade negotiation? Or is this just a power move?  Its something the president can do unilaterally that forces the leaders of other countries to come crawling to him to beg for a better tariff rate so it bloats his ego and maybe they make a little crypto donation to some wallet somewhere that isn't tracked or disclosed as a thank you.

Here is how it could work: People woult report their incomes as they do now, and also their annual savings, as many already do for tax-exempt retirement accounts. Their income minus their savings is their annual consumption, and that amount less a large standard deduction would be their taxable consumption. For example, a family thwt earned $100,000 and saved $20,000 in a tax year would have an annual consumption of $80,000.

KSL,Business,-0.0635,"Why make this unnecessarily political? In 2024, the United States faced a significant outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), commonly known as bird flu. To control the spread of this highly contagious and deadly virus among poultry, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) implemented a ""stamping-out"" policy, which involved culling infected and exposed flocks. This approach led to the culling of millions of birds, including chickens, across various states.  ￼ ￼ It's important to note that this culling policy is a standard disease control measure and not a direct order from President Biden. The USDA, following guidelines from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), mandates such actions to prevent further spread of the disease. While the administration supported these measures, they were part of established protocols for handling avian influenza outbreaks.  ￼ ￼ The culling had significant economic impacts, notably contributing to a rise in egg prices due to reduced supply. In response, the USDA explored alternative strategies, including the potential vaccination of poultry, to mitigate future outbreaks and lessen reliance on culling. However, concerns about vaccine efficacy and potential trade restrictions have made this a complex issue.  ￼ ￼ In summary, while the Biden administration supported the USDA's implementation of culling as a disease control measure during the 2024 bird flu outbreak, it was not a direct presidential order but rather adherence to established animal health protocols.

If what Trump is doing with the tariffs is beneficial to our country, why haven't other countries used tariffs to start trading wars? Why don't they raise tariffs on everyone by 10% or 25% or 100+%? Why haven't they done what we are doing if it's so good for the economy? What Trump is doing will hurt mom and pop businesses, the backbone of our country in order to bring production to factories we don't have and when/if they do get here it will be automated. That does not equate to having more jobs. Almost all of our food production, in the U.S., is owned by 9 companies. What if the tariffs are just another consolidation of power. Destroy most of the mom and pop businesses so that 10-15 or so companies can control most of what we produce? And therefore most of the money and power? I don't know if that's what IS happening… but since what is happening is so destructive and it doesn't make sense to me… I'm trying to make sense of it. What are the motivations? Is it just a trade war to get what Trump wants? And what exactly does he want? And if x, y and z actions equal a, b, c, why is that what Trump wants? What does he gain from it. Because Trump has shown us who he is. He doesn't hide how vindictive he is or that he's a bully or that he wishes he could control the media and our country and other countries through fear tactics.

The issue isn't that there are now tariffs where there were none before. The issue is that Trump took existing tariffs and increased them by 30-50% overnight, hoping that by doing so it would persuade American companies to do their manufacturing in the US. Problem with that logic is you need to spend months or years shoring-up domestic infrastructure to make that happen. We simply do not have the factories or low cost of living as other countries and it will take years for us to catch up. A smart business man would have slowly raised tariffs over 2-3 years, whilst simultaneously building factories and assembly plants in the US to push companies to do their manufacturing here now.

KSL,Business,-0.7886,"This comment is a textbook example of whataboutism—deflecting criticism of current policies by pointing fingers at past leaders rather than addressing the facts at hand. Let's focus on what's happening now. The claim that other countries charge the U.S. tariffs as high as 70% has been widely debunked. During his first term, President Trump repeatedly exaggerated the tariffs imposed by other nations. For example, he claimed the European Union charged a 100% tariff on U.S. cars—when in fact, it was 10%. Similarly, China's tariffs varied by industry but were nowhere near the numbers Trump publicly cited. [Source: FactCheck.org, March 2018; Peterson Institute for International Economics] In reality, average U.S. tariffs before Trump's trade war were around 1.6%, while other developed nations had comparable or slightly higher rates, depending on the sector—not the extreme imbalances often suggested. Tariff policy is complex, and singling out exaggerated figures distorts the bigger picture. As for previous presidents: Yes, Democratic and Republican administrations have used tariffs, but typically in targeted, strategic ways—not blanket tariffs on nearly all imports from dozens of countries, which is what we're seeing now. The broad and abrupt nature of these tariffs is why markets are reacting so negatively. Finally, dismissing market declines as just ""cycles"" ignores the direct link between investor confidence and policy. When tariffs are announced with inflated justification and without warning, it creates real economic shock. Americans—especially consumers and small businesses—bear the brunt of those costs.

Bukele (El Salvador) struck an agreement that everyone the USG deports to El Salvador would be incarcerated in an El Salvadorian jail.

Therefore, even with regard to aliens present within the United States, the Court has sometimes deferred to Congress's policy judgments that limit the ability of some classes of aliens to contest their detention or removal.

And yes (before someone says it), even illegals have due process rights in this country (SCOTUS justices have upheld that for over 140 years in various rulings). There is a reason Niemoller's ""First they came for..."" should be heeded for the warning that it is. If the government is willing to flat out ignore due process rights for those that are deemed ""other"" or ""less than"" by some (illegal immigrants, or those you *think* *might* have committed a crime), then it can be ignored for *any of us*. It could be ignored for U.S. citizens that we *think* might have committed murder, or *might* have stolen from a bank. It can be ignored for those that jaywalk, or speed, or run a red light. It can be ignored for journalists who report negatively on the current administration or your neighbor who attended a peaceful protest. It can be ignored for me, it can be ignored for you - and if everyone else has already been imprisoned, there will be no one left to stand up for your rights. What this administration has done with these individuals being shipped, with due process rights ignored, to a 3rd party country's prison that is known for torture and other human rights abuses should be absolutely concerning and a red alert to anyone that considers themselves at least a half decent American.

The two large most recent meta-analyses (one in JAMA pediatrics in 2025 and one in Environmental Research in 2023) DO show that high levels of fluoride in community drinking water are linked to lower IQ scores in children, BUT that that correlation is ONLY seen at fluoride levels HIGHER than are recommended for drinking water.  (Recommended fluoride level in drinking water is around 0.6-0.7 mg/L; the association with lower IQ scores is noticeable at 1 mg/L and more significant above 1.5 mg/L).  There is also clear and strong evidence that fluoride in drinking water reduces the rate of cavities, especially in children and most especially in children who have other risk factors for tooth decay.

In this case, Garcia was illegally sent to a torture prison, so the stay is preserving irreparable harm rather than preventing it.  Perhaps the Monday deadline was tight, but given the potentially harmful circumstance Garcia was illegally placed in, urgency seems warranted.  The administration's response to the order seems not to be a good-faith effort to meet the deadline, but a ""we can't try"" excuse. This isn't right.  I urge anyone justifying this with ""he was an MS-13 gang member"" to recall the origin of one of Trump's oft-used phrases: witch hunt.  Read The Crucible. Understand and remember McCarthyism.

The supposed information came from 1 single informant and could not be corroborated by any actual evidence (he has no record/evidence of gang affiliation in El Salvador, and no criminal record here in the states), the claim from that informant was given to an officer that was later suspended. In the end, the court determined that instead of being a member of gang, he was at high risk of being a victim of gang violence if he were to be returned to El Salvador and granted protected status in 2019. As noted, he has lived a quiet life here in the states with his wife, raising his family, and complying with all the immigration check-ins asked of him. He has been convicted of no crime - neither here, nor in El Salvador - and yet the Trump admin says that whatever evidence they *claim* to have (**but have refused to present as evidence in a court of law**) is enough to automatically sentence him to an undetermined amount of time in the Salvadoran equivalent of a Gulag without any of the due process rights afforded to *all* within the U.S., regardless of legal status (and upheld by SCOTUS over 140 years of rulings).

American politicians love to talk about how immigrants break the law and at the same time, they themselves break the law as they please, and they do this more than immigrants. There are police records that show born citizens commit more crimes than immigrants. Right now, immigrants everywhere are terrified and I'm talking about undocumented immigrants, immigrants that are here legally as well and even immigrants that are US citizens. They are all equally terrified and they all have been targeted in several ways. This is not enforcing the law. This is not a mistake. People are taken from the streets at night and no one knows where they are being taken. How is this normal? I want to add that not all immigrants just trample our laws when they come to US border. Many come to border to request political asylum. This is not trampling the law. By requesting asylum they are following the law. We cannot put all immigrants in the same box, doing this dehumanizes immigrants and sends people the message that they deserve to be mistreated because "" they are intentionally breaking the law"". What we are seeing here is dangerous. We are seeing the birth of an authoritarian government. Who will be next? Religious minorities? Members of movements and political parties? And keep in mind this: it is very disturbing the lack of compassion and empathy many american people have for immigrants and minorities, deeply disturbing. What happened to moral and Christian values? What kind of society are we creating? The law it's important, compassion is even more important. I'm not saying to allow everyone to enter illegally, I am saying to practice what we preach, equality, democracy for all, opportunity for those who want to work, help the needy and hungry. We are a big country with many resources that can be used to make the world a beautiful place or to destroy it. What are we doing to people inside our borders? What are we bringing to other countries? We are in the wrong here as a people and society with complete lack of empathy for those who suffer. It's unacceptable the kind of people we are becoming. We voted someone who has no principles and now we are all going to suffer the consequences, not just immigrants, but many learn lessons only after they themselves taste the consequences.

The GAO and OIG have reported hundreds of billions in improper payments across Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment, and pandemic programs. In 2021 alone, $281 billion. That's not spin—that's official data. Believing there's no waste, fraud, or abuse in the federal government is a wild hill to die on. And expecting years of embedded corruption to be prosecuted overnight is just more unhinged Trump hate. I never thought I'd see half the country hate one man—based entirely on media spin—more than they love exposing the very corruption that drains our economy, raises taxes, and kills freedom. But you want to talk embarrassment? Try the Democrat Party covering for Biden for years, then suddenly forcing him out once the damage was done.

Even if you don't use public transit, you still benefit from it: less cars on the road, faster commute, less wrecks, cleaner air, etc. Public transit can benefit all of us. My only complaint is that UTA should have more local bus routes which shuttle people to main hubs where they can get on the train. We don't need more busses from Weber/Davis counties to SLC. We need more local busses to the train stations. It would be nice not to have to drive 5 miles to catch a bus/train.

Just because other countries charge tariffs doesn't mean it's a one-size-fits-all solution. Tariffs are used to protect local industries, yes, but they also lead to higher costs for consumers and can spark retaliatory measures, ultimately hurting global trade. The goal should be fair trade, not a trade war. The key point is that tariffs often hurt consumers more than they help domestic industries in the long run. For example, if a country imposes tariffs on goods from the U.S., it raises the price for consumers in that country. Similarly, U.S. consumers face higher prices when tariffs are placed on foreign goods. While they might help specific industries in the short term, tariffs don't always lead to more jobs or manufacturing—they often push companies to find cheaper alternatives, like moving production elsewhere or increasing automation. Instead of relying on tariffs, the focus should be on policies that encourage innovation, investment in local industries, and creating a competitive market that benefits workers without making everything more expensive. Countries can boost domestic manufacturing through subsidies, tax incentives, and workforce training, without resorting to the blunt tool of tariffs.

If done right, this would shut down 95% of illegal immigration and stop most of these contractors, employers and others from taking advantage of illegals.  98% of illegals are coming for employment and to better their families life, and without the opportunity for employment, the vast majority would not come.

The same cycle always plays out: deflect, deny, gaslight. They deflect to past presidents who used tariffs, ignoring the crucial difference: those presidents used tariffs strategically, targeting specific countries and industries. In contrast, Trump's approach is broad and chaotic, imposing tariffs on virtually every country, even close allies, with little regard for long-term economic consequences. The defense of Trump's wildly inflated tariff charts—where some figures were 10 to 100 times higher than actual rates—only underscores the problem. These weren't harmless exaggerations; they were deliberate misinformation. Blaming other nations for ""taking advantage"" of us when trade relationships are often mutual and negotiated is just another part of the victim narrative that MAGA politics thrives on. We're told tariffs don't hurt consumers. That's false. Numerous studies, including those from nonpartisan economic institutes, have shown that tariffs raise prices for American consumers and businesses. These are the facts—but they're inconvenient, so they're ignored. Instead of endlessly deflecting with ""But Biden…"" or pretending there's some 3D chess game being played, maybe take a clear-eyed look at what your candidate is doing—and the real harm it's causing.

KSL,Politics,0.8749,"Tariffs Hurt American Companies. Not Foreign Countries. With the new tariffs in the news, a lot of people ask: ""Why don't you just make your products in the USA?"" It sounds simple. It's not. There are no domestic sources for many of the raw materials we need. And even if there were, the processing facilities—the ones that turn those materials into usable parts—aren't in the U.S. anymore. So even if we brought final assembly back onshore, we'd still have to import key components—and those are now taxed at over 100%. Here's what most people don't realize: Tariffs aren't paid by foreign companies. They're paid by U.S. businesses. We get the bill. And that cost? It gets passed on to you, the customer. No company can absorb a 104% tariff and survive. These tariffs don't punish China or any other country—they're a tax on American businesses and consumers. We've actually built our products in the U.S. before—right here in Utah. We paid well. But the work was tough—hot, itchy, physically demanding. We couldn't find people who wanted to do it long-term. Even with good pay, most workers quit after a few weeks. There are easier jobs out there with better conditions that pay the same or more. And maybe the hardest truth we've learned is this: People love the idea of buying American. But when it comes time to buy, they almost always go with the cheaper option. That's not a criticism—it's just reality. We can't fix global supply chains overnight. And we definitely can't do it while being taxed into oblivion by policies that hurt the very businesses trying to stay competitive and create jobs here at home. Another common question is: ""If tariffs are so bad, why does every other country use them?"" Good question. The truth is, tariffs can work—when used strategically. They're a tool. A scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Targeted tariffs can protect key industries, push back against unfair practices, or counter dumping. They're meant to solve specific problems. But blanket tariffs—broad taxes on entire product categories—hurt everyone. They don't stop our need for those parts. They just make them cost 100% more. That cost travels down the line and lands right in your wallet. There are no winners in a blanket tariff war. Prices rise. Businesses struggle. Jobs disappear. And your paycheck buys less. We should be using trade policy like a surgeon—carefully, with purpose. Not swinging blindly and hoping something good comes out of it.

KSL,Politics,0.7601,"I have honestly tried reading and listening to the points the administration is trying to make and they seem to come down to two main justifications: 1. Tariffs will result in more jobs because manufacturing will return to the US 2. Tariffs will being countries with trade imbalances back to the negotiating table and we can get a better deal The first is flawed because US labor is so expensive, most companies bringing manufacturing back to the US will only use the least amount of labor necessary while they transition to automation.  In the end, the products will still cost more but no significant increase in jobs.  And the second if flawed because countries with massive wage disparity will always be able to make goods cheaper than we do and will always have less buying power so there will always be a trade imbalance. However, the two justifications are at odds with each other.  Are we doing it to bring manufacturing (not really jobs) back to the US or to get a better trade negotiation? Or is this just a power move?  Its something the president can do unilaterally that forces the leaders of other countries to come crawling to him to beg for a better tariff rate so it bloats his ego and maybe they make a little crypto donation to some wallet somewhere that isn't tracked or disclosed as a thank you.

KSL,Politics,0.2519,"I understand where you all are coming from to a point.  I was never a huge union supporter because I've seen them abuse the system.  That said, this has little to do with the current AFLCIO union in question here.  Let me spit out a couple of thinking points just for consideration. - Unions in the private sector swing much more power when they mobilize.  UAW is a prime example of such a union.  AFLCIO union is nothing compared to what UAW unions get away with. - Federal workers are already constrained in their unions.  For example, federal workers cannot protest.  It is already against the law.  Remember when the Air Traffic Controllers tried that?  Yea, legally they were fired. - AFLCIO has saved countless people from troubles they were wrongfully accused of, members of the union or not.  Without a union representative government managers would be able to go unchecked against workers they don't like (prejudice or otherwise) and create a hostile work environment or even loss of job.  Taking that away from the workers, well, you consider the consequences. - This past year has seen one of the larger raises for civilian workforce in many years.  Usually they get less of a raise than what the current inflation factors are.  What started out as a $5 an hour job, today after several years would require a $15 an hour pay to match considering inflation.  Federal workers currently are sitting about $11 an hour, thus falling behind what inflation is taking away.  Unions have been trying to correct that action for years but don't seem to have much power in doing so. - How much further should a so-so powered union be penalized or restricted?  Seems the best benefit for federal workers protects them from is mostly rogue managers who are a dime a dozen in federal employ.  I get saving money, but not all federal workers are useless.  Only a few, but they are also in private sectors too.  Government employment isn't that special, not anymore.  It used to be once upon a time though.

The government did impose a pre funding for future retirements which has put USPS into a financial hole because the amount they required them to pre fund was overinflated, way more money than was necessary. This, in my opinion (and many others) was the first attempt by a republican president to destroy the Post Office and ready it to be privatized. Yet USPS has prevailed. I am sorry to hear that the union didnt properly represent your mother. I have personally seen them fight for and save jobs of many deserving employees. As you must know as a former employee, the management style at the USPS is very toxic and without the unionos would be even worse. So unions on occsion represent employees that maybe do not deserve it? Yes just like a defense attorney is required to defend their client even if he is guilty.

Some people will ""overstay"" their status.  Which is a big no no.  For example, if I student is going to school for a bachelor degree (They might have 4 years status to finish). If they take 5 or 6 years -- they have to ask for an extension.  Otherwise they are ""Out of Status"" This is something the school can help the students ...

The ACA was designed to take the burden of healthcare off the back of the government and back on to the individual, something I thought everyone around here was all for. I mean personal responsibility, pulling oneself up by the boot straps, not the government's job to take care of people, state's rights, yada yada (did I miss any of the usual tag lines?). Does that apply universally or only when a Republican is in the Whitehouse? It's an honest question. Matter of fact, while we're on the topic, the two entities in this country that dictate healthcare are insurance companies, and malpractice attorneys. You can thank both of them for your increase in cost, and for you not keeping your doctor. ",https://www.ksl.com/article/51292126/utah-politicians-react-to-trumps-90-day-pause-on-most-tariffs

For the worst year under Biden (2021) the index was up 7%. Going back to 1914 I see thirteen years with higher numbers than the worst year under Biden. Six of those years (1973, 1974, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981) were what I would call ""recent decades"" meaning within the five decades previous to Biden's worst year. The increases for those six years during recent decades ranged between 8.9 and 13.3 percent, all of which were significantly worse than Biden's worst year. Half of those years were under Republican presidents. And if you want to expand the analysis to include Biden's second-worst year, the numbers were worse for eight years under other presidents during recent decades, and half of those years were under Republican presidents. I think it's hard to blame Biden for ""record inflation"" when there were that many years that were worse under other presidents in recent decades. (And lest one tries to blame the Democratic presidents please note that half of those worse-than-Biden years during recent decades were under Republican presidents.) And, if you look at Biden's four years, the increase in the December-to-December CPI-U increase was not high during his last two years, 3.4 and 2.9 percent, which is pretty much in line with long term historical numbers, and it was trending downward during those last two years.

What is ""bad"" is blanket tariffs on entire countries. At least right now, we have a 104% tariff on everything from China. That tariff isn't paid by China…it's paid by the American companies that import products from China. We have no way of producing all of that here. Building factories takes years.

If what Trump is doing with the tariffs is beneficial to our country, why haven't other countries used tariffs to start trading wars? Why don't they raise tariffs on everyone by 10% or 25% or 100+%? Why haven't they done what we are doing if it's so good for the economy? What Trump is doing will hurt mom and pop businesses, the backbone of our country in order to bring production to factories we don't have and when/if they do get here it will be automated. That does not equate to having more jobs. Almost all of our food production, in the U.S., is owned by 9 companies. What if the tariffs are just another consolidation of power. Destroy most of the mom and pop businesses so that 10-15 or so companies can control most of what we produce? And therefore most of the money and power? I don't know if that's what IS happening… but since what is happening is so destructive and it doesn't make sense to me… I'm trying to make sense of it. What are the motivations? Is it just a trade war to get what Trump wants? And what exactly does he want? And if x, y and z actions equal a, b, c, why is that what Trump wants? What does he gain from it. Because Trump has shown us who he is. He doesn't hide how vindictive he is or that he's a bully or that he wishes he could control the media and our country and other countries through fear tactics.

KSL,Politics,-0.7886,"This comment is a textbook example of whataboutism—deflecting criticism of current policies by pointing fingers at past leaders rather than addressing the facts at hand. Let's focus on what's happening now. The claim that other countries charge the U.S. tariffs as high as 70% has been widely debunked. During his first term, President Trump repeatedly exaggerated the tariffs imposed by other nations. For example, he claimed the European Union charged a 100% tariff on U.S. cars—when in fact, it was 10%. Similarly, China's tariffs varied by industry but were nowhere near the numbers Trump publicly cited. [Source: FactCheck.org, March 2018; Peterson Institute for International Economics] In reality, average U.S. tariffs before Trump's trade war were around 1.6%, while other developed nations had comparable or slightly higher rates, depending on the sector—not the extreme imbalances often suggested. Tariff policy is complex, and singling out exaggerated figures distorts the bigger picture. As for previous presidents: Yes, Democratic and Republican administrations have used tariffs, but typically in targeted, strategic ways—not blanket tariffs on nearly all imports from dozens of countries, which is what we're seeing now. The broad and abrupt nature of these tariffs is why markets are reacting so negatively. Finally, dismissing market declines as just ""cycles"" ignores the direct link between investor confidence and policy. When tariffs are announced with inflated justification and without warning, it creates real economic shock. Americans—especially consumers and small businesses—bear the brunt of those costs.

Then the card shop gets this from the middleman - say double the price again. So the card shop gets it for $2 now. Does that price go to $3.23 or $4.92? Then our cost. Say they double the price. So if I purchased a card now, maybe it would be $4 now. Would it be $5.22 now or $9.84. So it depends if they decide to earn more money at each level because of the tariff, or pass the original tariff amount only to the final customer. Second thing. If cards are no longer coming into the country as quick, then the cards will be more rare, meaning the value goes up.

They may not stay in Boulder but they will not be back to Utah ever. Sundance and Redford did so much for putting Utah on a world map. It bought the diversity of the world to visit this State although it was always with much consideration of many even to visit the State. Our Governor and legislatures always know the way the World works, They don't. It is a sad day for the State. Citizens of Utah keep a watchful eye on the world outside of Utah when it comes to the Olympics and investing more tax funds .   The world each day is swaying away from the US, which does include Utah. The ally nations could take a lesser view on attending, although our enemies and authoritarian governed nations may show interest, Russia, N Korea etc. Goodbye to the great times at all the Park City Sundance Film Festivals. Sundance Resort has also gone the commercial way, they should change there name. It was a financial as well as mission decision by Sundance. It was a decision that had to be made in order to stay valid to it's beliefs. Utah prior was always a question to attendees in the past but in the current stae of leadership in this State as weel as coming from Washington, they chose correctly. If they had buckled as many others have Sundance would stand for nothing and with no vale.  Sundance will raise the bar now and move ahead. We can always hope Utah will realize someday they erred big time.  Mr Redford was as always cordial to thank Utah for the past as they has a Organization will move on.

Is the absurdity of that scenario not self-evident? Your ""statistical analyses"" were laughed out of court more than 60 times. They were smoke and mirrors. The simple answer is that in 2020 Donald Trump was hugely unpopular and many states implemented mail-in voting due to Covid. Since then, many of those state have implemented harsh voter suppression laws. In 2024, Biden was largely blamed for the bad economy that started under Trump, and many Democrats stayed home because they believed Trump couldn't possibly win (the same as they did in 2016). 25 million is just an absurd number invented out of thin air.

Those votes were not counted, because they were not cast by registered voters. Being able to cast a provisional ballot is the not the same thing as being register to vote.

Learn more from the U.S. Department of State about voting as a U.S. citizen abroad. U.S. citizens who were born abroad and have never lived in the United States. Your eligibility to vote is based on the state where your parents last lived or were registered to vote. Find out what states may permit you to vote absentee. Dual citizens living in the United States or abroad Meet your state's residency requirements You can be experiencing homelessness and still meet these requirements. Are 18 years old on or before Election Day In almost every state, you can register to vote before you turn 18 if you will be 18 by Election Day. Some states allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 by Election Day to vote in primaries. Are registered to vote by your state's voter registration deadline. North Dakota does not require voter registration. Who cannot vote? Non-citizens, including permanent legal residents, cannot vote in federal, state, and most local elections. Some people cannot vote after being convicted of a felony or if they are currently serving time for other types of crimes. Rules are different in each state. Check this guide from vote.gov to understand the laws in your state. Some people who have a mental disability may not be able to vote. Learn about your voting rights. Rules vary by state.

The idea to prove you're a citizen in order to vote is good, but this ACT goes way too far to make it difficult or impossible for many legal citizens to vote. The idea is that everyone has to register in person with proof of citizenship.  This could be a birth certificate with matching government issued ID (drivers license), or a passport or a few other uncommon methods.  Changing your ID (drivers license, for example) when you change your name, isn't the problem; the problem is that your new ID won't match your birth certificate.  If you have a passport, none of this is a problem.  Hundreds of millions of American's don't have a passport though. In-person registration completely denies all military serving outside of the US, the very people fighting for your right to vote, to register to vote.  There are rural places in the US that require hours of travel to get to an election office.  Disabled people often cannot travel.  Elderly people often times cannot travel. The SAVE Act also requires frequent purges of voter rolls, so even if you are registered now, you might not be later.  The people that may be able to register, despite the difficulties listed above, will have to do it again at some point. Creators of the ACT say that it is up to the states to fix these issues.

The reality is that military members are significantly undercompensated, especially when you factor in the sacrifices they and their families make. Lower pay, long deployments, constant relocations, and the increasing risk of being sent into conflict zones due to reckless foreign policy — it's not a trade-off that should be taken lightly. Blind loyalty should never outweigh real-world consequences. You can't claim to support the military while standing behind actions that undermine their livelihoods and stretch their families to the breaking point.

Rescinding a tradition like family days under the banner of ""readiness"" isn't just tone-deaf, it's insulting. Especially when bases like Hill AFB are already getting hammered by child care shortages due to hiring freezes. Sacrifice at home, sacrifice at work, where does it end?

BRAC began in 1988 with subsequent base closures in 1992,1993, 1995, and 2005 .  Over 350 installations were closed in total. Anyone think closing those 350 installations didn't impact anyone?  Anyone remember Defense Depot Ogden?  It now Business Depot Ogden.

That's the entirety of the analysis. Second, ""family days"" are a relatively new convention. I'm not sure of the exact date they came to be, but in the early 2000's ""family days"" were also extended to Hill AFB civilians - I know this because I was one. Later, civilians were no longer included in ""family days"" as a cost saving measure. I well remember the memo rescinding ""family days"" for civilians citing the enormous cost. Third, military and civilian jobs have no correlation. None. It's foolish to make comparisons. The USA spends more on our military than the next ten nations combined. Yes, add up the military budget of the second through eleventh countries that spend the most on their military (China and Russia on that list) and the USA spends more.

That spending keeps local businesses alive and generates tons of sales and property tax revenue. But when fear spreads, the economy feels it. Puma just announced 500 layoffs, partly because immigrants are spending less and going into hiding. When they stop shopping, businesses suffer, jobs get cut, and tax revenue drops.

KSL,Politics,-0.765,"Sen Curtis is trying to walk along the fence, he seems to be afraid to speak the truth about Trump's chaotic tariff policies. Tariffs, if used at all, need to be implemented with careful thought, and only in rare cases.  Perhaps, carefully thought out tariffs are warranted for China. However, Trump's reckless, across the board tariffs on more than 180 countries smacks of paranoia, and appears devoid of any careful thought at all.  Trump's ""everybody is trying to rip us off"" is totally off-base and is offending our valued allies. Trump's ill-conceived tariffs have caused chaos in the world economy, and damaged relationships with our valued allies.  In addition, tariffs are a regressive tax that harms middle and low income Americans. Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to push through a $4.5 trillion tax cut for the rich to be funded by raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. Under Trump's Project 2025 plan, the rich get richer, the middle and lower class are burdened with paying the regressive tariff tax, and the national debt keeps going up. Trump has a history of running his companies into the ground and filing bankruptcy.  It seems that Trump and the Maga-GOP are trying to do the same thing to our great country.

It increases cost of production.  It falsely elevates pay an position for the lazy and holds back the hard working and talented.  Unions teach people to do the least amount possible to get by.  It teaches people not to help others.  It teaches people not to be charitable.  Unions are contrary for hard work.  They are often on the side of abortion and do whatever you please on issues.  Unions are tied in with the left.  I would never work for a union because I would not allow others to control my progress in a company or hold down my pay.  Unions promote by time in the job and not by the quality of a persons work so eventually leaders in the company are not the best teachers or examples.

It allows the members of the association to have a voice with some clout when negotiating for teacher's salaries, benefits and working conditions.

This petition is just to get the issue on the ballot so that all of the voters cam voice their opinion of this piece of legislation. When I read some responses and comments, individuals seem to think that the teacher's association is similar to unions and the union mentality of job preservation. I don't believe that is the case here. When I talk about union mentality, I am speaking of the idea of individuals with the only purpose is job preservation. The teacher's association does preserve due process, but a bad teacher will lose their job. The ad from Parents United, which is currently playing on the radio telling people not to sign because it will take money away from the children and keep the teachers able to teach ""their radical agenda"" is really frustrating.

You can find this information at an article titled ""Biden vs. Trump: Who Had the Better Stock Market?"" by Colin Laidley. Therefore, if your retirement account lost money during the Biden administration it means that your retirement account did spectacularly poorly when compared to the  stock market. By comparison, so far during Trump's second administration the S&P500 is down by 11%.

If we don't fight the trade wars that have been going on for the past 30 years right now, then we've lost.  Trump isn't starting the trade wars he's just finally allowing America to fight back. And you also can't change history.  Reagan's economic policies were, without question, what saved democracy and the United States.  Did the rich get richer?  Yes.  Of course they did and yet so did everyone else.  The idea that you have to hate the rich in order to save the middle class is so blatantly anti-American it's repulsive.

KSL,Politics,-0.6996,"Here's my take on this. A statutory mistake was made during a massive undertaking to undo damage caused by previous administrations in allowing our country to become inundated with illegal immigration. Even with these efforts, the reversing of this damage is much slower than the infliction. If the law states that he must be brought back, bring him back, follow the law, then re-deport him correctly. I've done some research on this and consulted with a family member that works on a gang task force. The evidence is very credible against this guy and the fact that he is worried about violence from rival gangs supports the fact that he is very likely a gang member. Also, his legal status is, at minimum, questionable. I can accept some mistakes during this process and don't have any problem with them being corrected. Of course we will have to develop the processes along the way because we have never been in a position where 10's of millions of people with all kinds of motives were allowed to invade our country with ZERO oversight. Ideally, we would find some magical way to separate out the good folks just trying to chase the American dream and weed out the evil. Unfortunately, the past administration did not give us that option by allowing the borders to be completely open. Now we must clean it up and start over. I like the progress we are making and the admonition from the current administration for the good folks to come out of the shadows, possibly self-deport, and come back the correct, legal way.

Well, now the playing field is even for BYU and Utah, but they are both playing second fiddle to the BIG10 and SEC conferences, where the schools in those conferences are making close to $100 million per year.

Some of them are getting pretty demoralized, the price of tanking and saying losing is acceptable for any reason.  Ever try getting out of a negative situation?  Tons of work required. - Players sitting out and not playing because they got to rest or some lame excuse.  I love Lauri Markanen, but if he can't or won't play, he is of little to no value to the winning attitude this team desperately needs to transform to.  It's along the lines of Khawai Leonard, helps you win but only when he decides to play.  Yea, I'll cheer for a player who is trying his best to drive on an opponent while putting up with a broken finger, sprained wrist or ankle etc...  But this sitting nonsense has to stop with the Jazz and that starts with management and coaching and breads down into the players.  Some players are that way now, but it appears others may not be. Again, the price of tanking.  Lots of fans have left rooting for their local team because of it.

BYU could toss around numbers barely reaching the 5-digit mark and it would be talked about for weeks with all kinds of wild speculation going on. Unfortunately, there is already way too much money being thrown at these kids straight out of high school. I worry about their future and the future of the nation because of it.

Kinahan, IIRC, wrote an article recently saying that BYU was in a good place going forward wrt their basketball and football programs supporting some of the recent changes in coaching, NIL, Big 12 membership, etc. He has changed his tune a bit in this article making an observation only, probably after discussions with or listening to the comments of others in rebuttal to his first article. I don't think there is jealously there at all. Mr Kinahan makes his living commenting on ALL Utah sports, including BYU. When BYU does well, Mr. Kinahan stands to probably do even better depending on how his salary is negotiated. Think about it. The elephant in the room is the hypocrisy that his story hints to. I'm going to give a personal opinion and my opinion only. The ""Gospel"" of Jesus Christ is perfect. The ""Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"", whether the ""most"" true or not, is a LITTLE LESS perfect just because of our mortal nature; yet our most esteemed leaders tend to be VERY wise men, but not totally infallible... never have been. The ""average"" Church member is on ""average"" probably even a little less perfect!!! We therefore look to our leaders for wisdom and guidance as we as members try to get a little better each day knowing that each of will require some ""grace"" in the end. The Church divested itself from IHC and Primary Childrens Hospital years ago for a reason. I encourage you to read about it and it makes sense why given the global transformation of the Church and its biggest priorities. ""Perfecting"" the Saints is one of those... This is not a dissimilar situation given the Church's official relationship to BYU AND BYU athletics. The point that ""boosters"" are putting this $$$ up is really moot. I am a Church member and an Aggie and Ute alum. I cheer for those teams first but I still cheer for BYU in ALL other match-ups. Religion has NEVER had anything to do with Church or religion for that matter fo me but rather more a means to develop healthy, useful, and noble qualities.

KSL,Sports,-0.4426,"If elbowing a player in the face isn't a red card then what is? Honestly, someone who knows the rules better than me please explain. The goal getting called off was a hear breaker too. I didn't see clear and obvious video evidence from what they showed on the replay but I'm not sure what angles the ref was able to look at. Muktar flopping in the box was frustrating, I guess it's ok Palacio to not put himself in that position. Vera was incredible on defense, his defense and Cabral's saves kept us in the game. The offense looked really dangerous the first 15 minutes but then never really caught the spark again. ",https://www.ksl.com/article/51294051/rsl-concedes-late-penalty-for-2-1-loss-in-nashville

KSL,Sports,0.5647,"The offisde call was clearly correct. Yellow for the elbow was correct IMO.  Muhktar sold the contact like an actor but Palacio gave him the opportunity.I don't think the officiating was to blame for anything, RSL is just a team that cashed out on their proven goalscorers last year and didn't reinvest the money to get new ones.  If there is a plan the front office isnt communicating it to the fans.  It was some good fight from the squad though, I liked their effort.
