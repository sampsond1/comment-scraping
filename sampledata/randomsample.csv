Are you suggesting that a media outlet founded by Trump will be non-biased?I agree that some outlets will never give Trump credit for anything. Alternatively, many outlets have amplified his baseless lies. I am sure that some ""media"" has ""hid, denied and covered up"" what is most convenient for the political leanings of their subscribers.What concerns me is that many folks do not believe news that is unfavorable to their leaders/political party. There are several media outlets considered to be in the middle and that are more balanced, but if they report negatively on Trump it is branded as ""fake news"" and journalists are derided as an enemy.

KSL,Business,0.7601,"I have honestly tried reading and listening to the points the administration is trying to make and they seem to come down to two main justifications: 1. Tariffs will result in more jobs because manufacturing will return to the US 2. Tariffs will being countries with trade imbalances back to the negotiating table and we can get a better deal The first is flawed because US labor is so expensive, most companies bringing manufacturing back to the US will only use the least amount of labor necessary while they transition to automation.  In the end, the products will still cost more but no significant increase in jobs.  And the second if flawed because countries with massive wage disparity will always be able to make goods cheaper than we do and will always have less buying power so there will always be a trade imbalance. However, the two justifications are at odds with each other.  Are we doing it to bring manufacturing (not really jobs) back to the US or to get a better trade negotiation? Or is this just a power move?  Its something the president can do unilaterally that forces the leaders of other countries to come crawling to him to beg for a better tariff rate so it bloats his ego and maybe they make a little crypto donation to some wallet somewhere that isn't tracked or disclosed as a thank you.

Just because other countries charge tariffs doesn't mean it's a one-size-fits-all solution. Tariffs are used to protect local industries, yes, but they also lead to higher costs for consumers and can spark retaliatory measures, ultimately hurting global trade. The goal should be fair trade, not a trade war. The key point is that tariffs often hurt consumers more than they help domestic industries in the long run. For example, if a country imposes tariffs on goods from the U.S., it raises the price for consumers in that country. Similarly, U.S. consumers face higher prices when tariffs are placed on foreign goods. While they might help specific industries in the short term, tariffs don't always lead to more jobs or manufacturing‚Äîthey often push companies to find cheaper alternatives, like moving production elsewhere or increasing automation. Instead of relying on tariffs, the focus should be on policies that encourage innovation, investment in local industries, and creating a competitive market that benefits workers without making everything more expensive. Countries can boost domestic manufacturing through subsidies, tax incentives, and workforce training, without resorting to the blunt tool of tariffs.

The idea to prove you're a citizen in order to vote is good, but this ACT goes way too far to make it difficult or impossible for many legal citizens to vote. The idea is that everyone has to register in person with proof of citizenship.  This could be a birth certificate with matching government issued ID (drivers license), or a passport or a few other uncommon methods.  Changing your ID (drivers license, for example) when you change your name, isn't the problem; the problem is that your new ID won't match your birth certificate.  If you have a passport, none of this is a problem.  Hundreds of millions of American's don't have a passport though. In-person registration completely denies all military serving outside of the US, the very people fighting for your right to vote, to register to vote.  There are rural places in the US that require hours of travel to get to an election office.  Disabled people often cannot travel.  Elderly people often times cannot travel. The SAVE Act also requires frequent purges of voter rolls, so even if you are registered now, you might not be later.  The people that may be able to register, despite the difficulties listed above, will have to do it again at some point. Creators of the ACT say that it is up to the states to fix these issues.  So what happens when the states don't fix it or don't fix it in time for an election, which seems to be very real scenarios.
